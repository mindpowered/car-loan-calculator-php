# Installation

You can get carloancalculator using Composer. Composer manages dependencies for packages from Packagist and you can get it here: <https://getcomposer.org/> .

Create a composer.json file in the top-most directory of your project and add `mindpowered/carloancalculator` to the requirements:
```
{
        "require": {
                "mindpowered/carloancalculator" : "*"
        }
}
```
Now you can run the command to update composer: `composer update`. In order for composer to install the package dependencies you will need an archive manager such as zip installed. Composer requires use of the commands `zip` and `unzip`.
